# Lane Detection

This project implements a lane detection system utilizing computer vision techniques to identify lane markings on roads. It is particularly useful for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). The system analyzes images or video feeds from vehicle cameras to provide real-time lane tracking.
